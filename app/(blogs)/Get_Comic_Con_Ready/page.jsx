        The Power of Superhero Nutrition
      </h2>
      <p>
        Cosplay, nutrition, and fitness may not seem like they go hand in hand,
        but when it comes to preparing for Comic Con, fueling your inner hero is
        essential.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        And hey, eating like a superhero doesn't mean you have to sacrifice
        taste!
      </p>
      <h2 id="building-your-superhero-plate">Building Your Superhero Plate</h2>
      <p>
        Fuel like a superhero by incorporating nutrient-dense foods into your
        diet, such as lean protein, colourful fruits and vegetables, whole
        grains, and healthy fats. Some examples are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Incorporate lean protein sources like grilled chicken, turkey, or tofu
          to support muscle growth and repair.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a splash of colour to your plate with a variety of fruits and
          vegetables, like spinach, berries, bell peppers, and carrots.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't forget to include whole grains like quinoa, brown rice, or whole
          wheat bread for sustained energy throughout the day
        </li>
        <li>
          Boost your superhero fuel with healthy fats such as avocados, nuts,
          and olive oil for brain function and satiety.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Not only will these foods provide your body with the essential nutrients
        it needs to thrive, but they can also give you that extra boost of
        energy to keep up with all the excitement at Comic Con.
