      <p>
        Are you ready to take your cosplay game to the next level at your next
        Anime Expo? We’ve all seen those jaw dropping cosplays both online and
        at the expo’s but if you haven’t noticed already, there’s always 1
        ingredient that all cosplayers use, and that’s “fitness”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless we have the crafting or building capabilities of Yuzuriha or
        Kaseki from Dr Stone to make our cosplay outfits look absolutely
        immaculate, we’d have to make our body more toned to create a body shape
        that fits for our characters cosplay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lets say you’re cosplaying as Gohan from Dragon Ball or Maki from Fire
        Force, for both of these cosplays, a fair amount of training has to be
        done to get those toned arms, lean physique and shaped abdomen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned cosplayer looking to level up,
        this blog post will be your ultimate guide to embarking on your quest to
        become the protagonist of what would feel like your very own isekai.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anime Expo won&#39;t know what hit &#39;em when you strut in with a
        physique that&#39;s as powerful as Goku&#39;s punches and as graceful as
        Sailor Moon&#39;s moves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let&#39;s dive in and discover the fitness tips that will help you
        become the cosplay champion you&#39;ve always dreamed of being!
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a variety of exercises and workouts that will help you improve
        your overall fitness level and physique which I’ll be putting below.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Walking or Jogging</li>
        <li>Swimming</li>
        <li>Cycling</li>
        <li>HIIT Training</li>
        <li>Group Classes</li>
        <li>Calisthenics</li>
        <li>Fitness apps/Online workouts</li>
        <li>Resistance Training</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        All of these are great at helping you get fitter and lose that stubborn
        fat you’re looking to lose to look and feel like your favourite
        superheroes, but depending on your goals, some are better than others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best exercises and workouts that have a direct correlation for
        losing fat in the short term, but also if consistent are;
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Walking or Jogging</li>
        <li>Swimming</li>
        <li>Cycling</li>
        <li>HIIT Training</li>
        <li>Group Classes</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The best exercises and workouts for losing fat and also gaining muscle
        in the long term are;
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Calisthenics</li>
        <li>Fitness apps/Online workouts</li>
        <li>Resistance Training</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The reason behind some exercises being mainly for cardio, and others
        focusing on gaining muscle are as follows. Cardio or weight based cardio
        (HIIT training, Group classes), will burn roughly the same amount of
        calories are burned every time you do that specific thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lets say you go for a 30 minute walk everyday, depending how fast you
        walk, you’ll burn between 100-300 calories or 700-2100 calories per
        week. You can burn more calories by increasing the intensity of the
        exercise, or doing other exercises like jogging or cycling, but I’m sure
        you may already know this, so we’re looking to level up from here.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we’re looking for is sustained fat loss, and more calories burned
        by doing less overall. Let me explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a few factors as to why a majority of people are able to eat
        more and stay lean. This is due to a few factors:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Tracking calories/macronutrients</li>
        <li>Diet induced thermogenesis</li>
        <li>Gaining Muscle</li>
        <li>A metabolism increase</li>
        <li>Getting adequate sleep</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Tracking calories/macronutrients</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don’t know already, calories are the energy in food and the
        macronutrients are the proteins, carbs and fats that the calories add up
        to. When burning more energy (calories) in the day by doing any form of
        exercise, as long as your calories are lower overall, you will lose
        weight in the form of fat.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Diet induced thermogenesis</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Diet induced thermogenesis however, is how much heat your body has to
        use to metabolise the food you’ve ingested. Think of it this way, lets
        compare calories to when you stoke a fire. Let’s compare firewood 1 (f1)
        which we will say is carbs, to firewood 2 (f2) which is protein.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine adding a few F1 pieces to an already lit fire. We observe it and
        it burns for an hour. We then add the same amount of F2 pieces to the
        fire and then observe it’s been burning for 3 hours.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Carbs and proteins make the body produce heat so they can be metabolised
        in the body. On the other hand, fat is burned like putting a bunch of
        papers on the fire but spread out. It’ll still make a fire and will
        burn, but not for long.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that when having a high protein diet, not only will you burn
        calories by working out, but you will also burn calories from the food
        itself, being metabolised.
      </p>
      <p>
        Disclaimer: Make sure to still have a suitable amount of fats in your
        diet as fats are important for healthy hormone function and overall
        health.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Gaining Muscle</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When training with any sort of resistance, whether it’s calisthenics
        (bodyweight), free weights (dumbbells, barbells), or using machines at
        the gym, the muscles being used will have very small tears, and our
        bodies will repair it by pushing blood to that area to fill up the gaps
        in the muscle tissue with new fibers, almost like adding plaster over a
        hole or crack without sanding it down.
      </p>
      <p>
        As muscle is gained over time, we have to eat more so our bodies can
        continue to house all of this additional muscle. This is why Goku and
        Vegeta eat so much. Not only do they train heaps, they have to keep
        their newly formed muscle through good and added nutrition, as well as
        training hard and knowing when to rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A Metabolism Increase</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When training consistently, and adding muscle, our bodies understand
        that we’re in need of more consistent nutrition to keep up with demands.
        This is automatic and happens when any of the above points are followed
        including training more, gaining more muscle, eating certain foods, and
        even through stimulants such as caffeine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following all of the advice above will help with a metabolism increase,
        which will assist in sustained fat loss and/or muscle growth (depending
        on the activities and goals), as well as being able to eat more, and
        better, which leads to a healthier lifestyle overall which leads to
        looking and feeling better in our anime cosplay outfits.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Getting adequate sleep</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We all know sleeping is super important. We see Zoro training and
        sleeping heaps in One Piece.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        The main reasons sleep is good for you is, it both will help you recover
        after a workout, which means muscles having more nutrients and blood
        flow which is great for better workouts, as well as, it helps regulate
        hormones, which will lead to more energy, feeling fuller and consuming
        less overall the next day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sleeping well and for an adequate amount (6-9hrs of sleep per night
        depending on the individual), will help sustain a healthy lifestyle and
        will keep you on track with your cosplay fitness goals.

        Now that we’ve spoken about the fundamentals, let’s speak more about
        training to look like your favourite anime characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        We all have different favourite anime characters, and some have
        different body shapes to others, so we have to be reasonable with whom
        we choose to cosplay as, but we can train to get as close as possible to
        the physique.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider trying to cosplay a few different characters such as Goku, Kale
        (DBZ), Mikasa Ackermann, Baki or All Might. To get this amount of muscle
        mass, this may take many years of sticking to a plan, training
        consistently and hard. This can still be achievable with patience.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are other characters a lot of people tend to cosplay as they tend
        to be more achievable with most physiques such as Naruto, Hinata, Levi
        Ackermann, Monkey D. Luffy (Pre time-skip), and others. Their physiques
        are closer to a natural and thin bodyshape, so there isn’t a lot of
        weight training needed, but a healthy lifestyle, including consistent
        cardio or training is preferred.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve gone into a bit of depth with nutrition and sleep, so the below
        will be the best cosplay fitness tips that will level up your cosplay
        for Anime Expo.

      </h2>
      <p>
        Imagine we’re looking to build a physique like Sasuke, Sakura or Ichigo
        Kurosaki. All 3 characters are pretty thin, strong and do a lot of
        running.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        When focusing on a workout program, there are many variables to take
        into account including how active we are day to day as well as how much
        cardio we do. This will be our daily caloric expenditure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a hypothetical scenario, person A doesn’t have a car, does no cardio
        and takes public transport daily to get to work, whereas person B has a
        car and does 35 minutes of light walking as cardio daily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose that person A has a 10 minute walk to the local train station,
        then an extra 7 minutes walk to work. If we add the trip there and back,
        that’s a total of 34 minutes of light walking.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we compare Person A (34 minutes) walking to Person B (35 minutes),
        Person A, even though inconsistent, will burn roughly the same amount of
        calories and get almost the same amount of walking time in the day as
        Person B.
      </p>
      <p>
        The above also relates to us as kids. Being a kid in school, we were
        constantly on our feet, walking, and playing games with friends. I’m
        sure majority of us weighted less in school than we do now. This is
        mainly due to our activity levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving around more in the day constitutes to more calories being burned
        which can lead to consistent fat loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        A combination of moving more overall by doing additional cardio, group
        classes, eating less calories than you burn and keep this consistent
        will help you lose fat and get and even keep the anime cosplay physique
        you’ve been wanting all your life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be patient and grind hard! Our favourite anime characters didn’t get to
        their peaks by just sitting around.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Building a Muscular Cosplay Physique</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I know this is what most people reading this is looking for, so
        let’s get into chatting about gaining a bunch of muscle.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve all seen our favourite anime characters doing some sort of
        training. One way or another, we have to exercise to gain muscle. Zoro,
        Asta, Goku, and many others train with some sort of resistance including
        weights. No matter what we do or what supplements we take, we have to
        train hard for quite some time to have a physique with considerable
        muscle on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll give you a few examples in order of how long it can take to have a
        similar physique to certain characters if you’re an average weight,
        height and haven’t trained in the past.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Deku - 3 months to 1 year</li>
        <li>Monkey D. Luffy (Post timeskip) - 6 months to 2 years</li>
        <li>Inouske - 1 to 3 years</li>
        <li>Saitama - 1.5 to 4 years</li>
        <li>Zoro (Wano Arc) - 2 to 6 years</li>
        <li>Goku - 3 to 10 years</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These are somewhat sensible timeframes and these physiques can
        definitely be achieved sooner, but a rigorous training program and diet
        plan are necessary. Additionally, understanding fundamentals are a big
        step, and it can be hard to make progress without understanding
        fundamentals within both training and diet.
      </p>
      <h3 id="optimal-types-of-training">Optimal Types of Training</h3>
      <p>
        Regarding what sort of training should be done, the only recommended
        training to gain the most amount of muscle in the soonest amount of time
        is resistance training while gradually increasing the load or volume.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, doing 2 sets of 10 chest presses with 10kg dumbbells will
        help gain muscle, but doing 11 repetitions or even 12 the next time,
        will push the muscles further and will allow for more muscle growth.
        This concept is called progressive overload.
      </p>
      <p>
        Progressive overload is best achieved by gradually increasing the weight
        of the exercise over time, and staying consistent with a good program
        for the individual that’s goal focused.
      </p>
      <p>
        Completing different sort of workouts such as calisthenics, functional
        training with weights, and any sort of weighted workouts will promote
        muscle growth.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re not looking to “get in shape” in the shortest amount of time,
        don’t enjoy the gym and want to still work on your physique, other
        options such as Calisthenics, Crossfit and functional training with
        weights are still great alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calisthenics is known to be a great start at home and can definitely
        promote muscle growth over time.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        When building a physique like Inosuke, Saitama, Zoro and Goku, a gym is
        highly preferred as training at home or a home gym can only get you so
        far in a short amount of time, since there are restrictions in weights,
        exercises that can be completed, and machines.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, a physique as high as Saitamas can be achieved solely
        from calisthenics and will look great but may take a considerable amount

        Machines are highly recommended, both cables and traditional machines,
        as they target the specific muscle you’re looking to target. There is a
        bit more depth to this, including proper form and programming, but
        overall, having access to machines will help your physique improve
        drastically.

        Lastly, having a fair amount of movement throughout the day will also
        help as this will promote blood flows to the muscles to allow them to
        recover faster which allows for more recovered training.

        As stated above, gaining more muscle will also promote an increase in
        metabolic rate which means, being leaner, looking bigger and eating more
        are achievable.{" "}
