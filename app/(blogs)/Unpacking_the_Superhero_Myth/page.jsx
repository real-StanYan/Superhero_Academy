        There are so many Superhero shows and movies coming to our big screens
        that it&apos;s hard to keep up. Do we really want think Superheroes are
        good role models and should they watch these movies/shows? Let&apos;s
        discuss.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back at our childhood. I know myself, I watched ToastedTV as a
        kid which included shows such as Justice League of America, Naruto,
        Dragon Ball Z and One Piece.

        They were all great cartoons that taught me a lot, including to always
        respect family and protect the ones you love.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, family in these series aren&apos;t always blood related, but the
        knowledge it provided me personally to protect my friends was a big
        deal.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has made me realise that, these shows have provided me with a lot
        of emotional intelligence which I wouldn&apos;t have been able to learn
        anywhere else.

        I know a lot of people that haven&apos;t watched the same shows as me
        and have become great people themselves as well. This could be through
        what they&apos;ve learned from friends, family or other shows they were
        watching.
      </p>
      <p>
        There isn&apos;t a calculator for emotional intelligence, but I could
        tell that a lot of friends that didn&apos;t watch the same shows
        wouldn&apos;t treat friends the same way and would unintentionally
        discard them at the slightest inconveniences.

        I&apos;ve had situations where I saw friends being bullied, and I would
        stick up for them just as my favourite Superheroes would.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand that there&apos;s a lot of violence in these shows,
        especially a lot of fighting, but with a good and stable upbringing,
        these shows can provide our kids with great insight and give them a lot
        of emotional intelligence, which isn&apos;t possible to get through our
        schooling system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let&apos;s change the topic to kids shows for a sec such as Peppa Pig
        and Cocomelon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pic of peppa/cocomelon</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Peppa Pig is meant to be a kids show, yet Peppa Pig has a big attitude
        problem. She calls her dad a silly dad and also calls him fat.
        She&apos;s also bossy, rude to her friends and her parents do nothing to
        discipline her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cocomelon has also had a bad rep. Many parents have said that the second
        they put it on, their kids tend to hyperfocus and can watch it for many
        hours at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second it&apos;s turned off they, tend to be grouchy and moody. This
        is due to the show being so overstimulating. The second their focus is
        moved away from the show, they crave dopamine in any form, especially
        wanting to continue to watch Cocomelon.
      </p>
      <p>
        When comparing to the other shows such as Peppa Pig and Cocomelon, Peppa
        Pig is just a bratty kid wanting their own way, and is incredibly rude
        to both their family and their friends and aren&apos;t disciplined by
        her parents whatsoever. This is detrimental as it creates an entitled
        child that doesn&apos;t listen to family or reason. Cocomelon on the
        other hand has nothing to learn from. It&apos;s so stimulating, and for
        no reason besides trying to keep our kids engaged so they can watch
        more.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, some kids shows such as Bluey are pretty good for our
        kids as it&apos;s a slice of life show that shows what a real loving
        family looks like. It has great pacing and teaches our kids many life
        lessons while being engaging enough for our kids to enjoy it too. Even
        adults are watching it! So there are some great kids shows out there
        too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve watched a lot of Superhero shows/movies and anime, and
        don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;d definitely hyperfocus on them mainly
        because they&apos;re trying to draw attention and they&apos;re just so
        good that I&apos;m invested. The thing is, I wouldn&apos;t get grouchy
        when I stop watching, quite the opposite, I feel invigorated and feel
        the need to do more with my time and life.
      </p>
      <p>It&apos;s surprising how much there is to learn from these movies.</p>
      <p>
        For example, even if people are angry at others, for example Damian
        Wayne (Batman/Bruce Waynes son) is always angry at his father and
        doesn&apos;t listen to him, but Bruce is patient and give many good one
        liners and teaches him how to care more for others. This in turn changes
        Damian over time whom becomes a better person and takes on the role of
        Batman himself after he&apos;s unable to save Batman in one of the
        comics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel superheroes are great role models as they tend to protect others
        that aren&apos;t able to protect themselves, no matter who they are, but
        some can also take things the wrong way.
      </p>
      <p>
        For reference, here&apos;s a one liner from an action/thriller anime
        I&apos;ve watched as a kid growing up called, Naruto.
      </p>
      <p>If you don&apos;t like your destiny, don&apos;t accept it.</p>
      <p>Instead, have the courage to change it the way you want it to be!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Naruto Uzumaki</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This stems from the above though. With a stable upbringing and
        discipline, our kids can learn how to be good role models for themselves
        and their peers through watching Superheroes serve justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Superheroes, even though portrayed as superior beings, are just like
        anybody else. They aren&apos;t perfect, but they are always learning and
        trying to be better versions of themselves. I feel we, as well as our
        kids can benefit and learn a lot from all of these new shows/movies
        coming out.
      </p>
      <p>
        TLDR; Many adults I&apos;ve spoken to that have read comics, watched
        superhero movies and anime have higher emotional intelligence than
        people that haven&apos;t. A variety of kids shows are actually a bad
        influence on kids, even though we think they&apos;re harmless, but some
        can be good. Superheroes can be a good influence for our kids provided
        we give them the correct amount of guidance and discipline.
